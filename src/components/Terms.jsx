        <h3>1. Highly Volatile Nature:</h3>
        <h5>
          Cryptocurrencies, including Rupaya, are known for their extreme price
          fluctuations. The value of cryptocurrencies can experience rapid and
          substantial changes, resulting in potential gains or losses for
          investors and users
        </h5>
      </div>

      <div className="Terms-Text-Box">
        <h3>2. Market Risks:</h3>
        <h5>
          The cryptocurrency market operates 24/7 and is influenced by various
          factors, including market sentiment, regulatory developments,
          technological advancements, and macroeconomic trends. As a result,
          market movements can be unpredictable and may not always align with
          conventional financial markets
        </h5>
      </div>

      <div className="Terms-Text-Box">
        <h3>3. Regulatory and Legal Risks:</h3>
        <h5>

          over time. Changes in regulations or legal restrictions can impact the
          usage, value, and availability of cryptocurrencies
        </h5>
      </div>

      <div className="Terms-Text-Box">
        <h3>4. Security Risks:</h3>
        <h5>
          While blockchain technology provides a secure framework, individual
          users must also take responsibility for safeguarding their wallets,
          private keys, and personal information. Cyberattacks, hacking,
          phishing, and other security breaches can lead to the loss of funds

          are speculative in nature. Past performance does not guarantee future
          results, and there is no guarantee of profits
        </h5>

          institution. The lack of central authority may lead to limited
          recourse in case of disputes or unforeseen events
        </h5>
      </div>

        <h3>7. Due Diligence: </h3>

          research and due diligence. Understand the project's goals, team,
          technology, and potential risks before making any investment or
